    <p>I do change stuff, mostly in the public sector, with just enough internet.</p>
    <p>This means designing strategies for doing, delivering and managing products, and shaping services and organisations. Using the best of internet era ways of working to coach teams, make change happen and help organisations thrive in a networked world.</p>
    <h3>Currently…</h3>

    <h3>Before that...</h3>
