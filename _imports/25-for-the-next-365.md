Another trip around the sun, some rules to help you get it done:

1. Give a damn.
2. Look after yourself.
3. Always question whether it needs to be a deck.
4. Find your circle and protect it.
5. The work we do is a privilege, remember that.
6. It’s probably not the client’s fault.
7. You’re right, but we’re not ready.
8. The conditions will never be better than now.
9. Start where you are, use what you have, do what you can.
10. Trust your gut. But remember confidence can feel like knowledge.
11. One step ahead might be enough for now, but not for long.
12. Never settle.
13. Never stop learning.
14. Tell the truth (bs never works long term).
15. Don’t use quotes if you don’t know where they’re from.
16. It’s probably been done before, so respect that, but do it better.
17. Be yourself. Don’t try to fit in, you’re a standout.
18. Your job title doesn’t determine your impact.
19. We’re all designers. Don’t kid yourself.
20. Say no.
21. Write it down, it’ll be useful later and your future self will thank you for it.
22. Slow down.
23. The rules are made up, so the rules don’t matter.
24. Smile.
25. Do your timesheets.
